It's worth noting, this is 99.9% the same as the regular The Firemen japanese game with a different header, where instead of the plain English game title there is now a Kanji version. So unless you really, really hate English letters in your internal titles, this is more of the same. Since it is really that close in size, I put it in with [The Firemen (USA) (Beta) ROM](https://eludevisibility.org/the-firemen-usa-beta/ "The Firemen (USA) (Beta) ROM") that I posted months ago.
